# mazeMaker
<b> Description </b>
Creates random mazes and solves them using disjoint sets datastructure and BFS algorithm

<b> How to Run </b>
After cloning repo,
1) in a terminal run <i> make </i>
2) run newly made file ./mazes

This will generate two mazes a small one 10x10 and a larger one 750x750 and output both the empty maze and the solved maze.
- smallMaze.png is the small randomly generated maze unsolved
- smallMaze_solved.png is the small maze solved
- same thing with bigMaze


In main.cpp the size of the maze can be changed by changing the width and height in the call to makeMaze(width,height)
